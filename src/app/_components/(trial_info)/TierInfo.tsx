        <p>Supports requiring DPS Backgrounds:</p>
        <p>
          As a support, your value is providing uptimes in content. This is
          harsh, but if you aren't, you aren't doing your job, and the team
          could be better off dropping you for a support/parse DPS. The best way
          to practice muscle memory with uptimes is by DPSing. DOTs, HOTs,
          buffs, debuffs - they're all uptimes. Good supports topparse in
          content! Good DPS, Good support; Bad DPS, Bad support. It's the same
          muscle memory. For this reason, supports need to be better DPS than
          actual DPS!
        </p>
        <p>Step 1: Do 115k+ on a 21m dummy. (If not 125k or higher!)</p>
        <p>
          Step 2: Bring all of that damage into content. (This is where the real
          development happens)
        </p>
        <p>Step 3: Use the same muscle memory to provide uptimes in content.</p>
        <p>
          Remember to DPS on a damage-dealer character in a damage-dealing
          setup. (Ingame Armory + Wizard's Wardrobe are great!)
        </p>
        <p>DO NOT parse on your healer/tank char in a healing/tanking setup!</p>

        <p>
          Tier 2 is the highest tier players can obtain with a Velothi Ur parse.
          Velothi Waivers are available, explained below
        </p>
        <p>Velothi-Ur Waiver:</p>
        <p>
          -Anyone on any class can earn a waiver for Velothi-Ur if they submit a
          genuine parse above 0.90 la/s.
        </p>
        <p>
          -The formula for Arcanists using beam is: total light attacks / (total
          time - (fatecarver casts)(morph duration - 1))
        </p>

        <p>Alternative Submissions:</p>
        <p>
          ESOLogs submissions are authorized for any role, any tier, but
          performance is meticulously analyzed (especially uptimes). This is the
          hardest route. 6m dummy parses are authorized for DPS tiers on an
          alternate ladder. For both cases, DM Engineer Karl for submission. DM
          @Engineer_Karl if interested.
        </p>

        <p>Up-Or-Out Policy Grace Periods:</p>
        <p>
          Apprentice in any TGC guild and any rank in TNC will have an "up or
          out" policy. This means that people need to move up the Tier ladder
          within "X" months or they get removed. As a whole, Unverified have 30
          days to be Verified, and Apprentice has 90 days to reach Tier 1.
          Ultimately We really don't care about the timespan people do this in
          so long as they are actively trying. We may be willing to grant time
          extensions for weeks or months upon request, but we may require
          something like weekly accountability parses to prove constant effort.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>Tier 3 & 4 DPS require "Setup Archetype, explained below:</p>
        <p>
          Use an addon like Wizard's Wardrobe or AlphaGear (your preference) to
          set up a "Boss"/"Parse" setup (ST), a "Trash"/"AoE" setup, &
          optionally more setups such as "Hybrid", "PvP", etc. Then couple
          screenshots of the existence of at least the first two (ST/AoE) setups
          with your parse. For setup questions and advice on specifics, ask in
          the ‚Å†academy. We don't care what your archetypes are or if they're
          "right" or "wrong". We just want you to be thinking about them.
        </p>

        <p>(U42) Tier 8 requires 3 of the following scores:</p>
        <p>vMA 615k - Not tracked by Pithka's</p>
        <p>vVH 315k</p>
        <p>vHRC 162k</p>
        <p>vAA 153k</p>
        <p>vSO 180k</p>
        <p>vMOL 172k</p>
        <p>vHOF 232k</p>
        <p>vAS 117k</p>

        <p>vSS 260k</p>
        <p>vKA 251k</p>
        <p>vRG 315k</p>
        <p>vDSR 350k</p>
        <p>vSE 280k</p>

        <p>
          People can get Tier'd up via nomination by raid leader in a super
          secret staff channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a healer or tank's performance (specifically in uptimes) does not
          meet the level we expect for a player of that tier, they are subject
          to demotion.
